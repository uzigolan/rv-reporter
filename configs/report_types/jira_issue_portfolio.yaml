  Analyze Jira portfolio health across projects.
  Must include:
  - opened / in-progress / closed issue counts by project
  - who is responsible (project lead + top active assignee per project)
  - assignees with highest active backlog and low closure contribution (with counts)
  - project-level backlog pressure and closure ratio
  - top assignee workload concentration
  - oldest active (non-closed) issues and aging risk
  Distinguish observed facts from inferred risk.
  Provide practical actions for triage and closure acceleration.
